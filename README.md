## Welcome to the Riocontra Translator :fire:

[Riocontra Translator](https://spig95.github.io/riocontra-translator/) is the 
only website that allows you to impress your friends with astonishing skills in 
translating from Italian to Riocontra! 
:sunglasses:

For the moment, this is available only in italian :it:. An english-to-riocontra 
translator and an english version of the website will be ready in 3020 to 
celebrate the 1kth anniversary of the website.

### Seriously, what's this?

COVID confinement gave me some time to learn HTML/CSS/JS basics. 
This was my first playground to test what I have learnt. :metal:
